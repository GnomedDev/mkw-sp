{"timestamp":"1673889827","author":"GnomedDev","description":"~~Fixing kart select is going to be harder than I thought. It is currently broken due to the page merging effort (the UI flow has been changed to mimic VS, then branch back to battle mode when loading demo) as the normal `VehicleSelectPage` doesn't contain the code `onActivate` for calling `0x80860bf0` and setting the `LayoutUiControl`s up correctly, which even if that is fixed will probably only solve the missing thumbnails and not the missing model and spinning animation.~~"}
