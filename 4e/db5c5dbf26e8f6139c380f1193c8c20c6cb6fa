This technically saves a lot more than necessary, as I went through trying to find what would stop desyncs, but the headers could be useful for future use.\r\n\r\n`KartSaveState` is currently sized at `4560` (`0x11d0`), so it isn't a massive memory hog.\r\n\r\nThis could be bound to a button, which I may do in this PR or a future PR depending on how long it takes to merge, but is currently bound to the `/store` and `/reload` commands.","baseCommit":"caecd8dfc760f51adef719f3daf097f8b952e5c8"}
