{"timestamp":"1686785465","reviewRef":"refs/pull/655/head","targetRef":"refs/heads/main","requester":"GnomedDev","description":"Implement basic Track Pack System\n\nThis implements the Track Pack system somewhat described in the document and allows for pack authors to bundle custom tracks with a manifest to allow users to play CTs without needing the jank of \"My Stuff\".\r\n\r\nThis system will read `.ini` files from the `mkw-sp/Track Packs` folder, which contains metadata and lists of tracks for each mode.\r\nTracks are stored in the `mkw-sp/Tracks` folder, which stores tracks as `sha1.ext` (where ext is `.szs` or `.arc.lzma`) and this `sha1` is looked up in `mkw-sp/TrackDB.ini` to fetch name and slot information. Thumbnails are also looked up using this `sha1` in `mkw-sp/Track Thumbnails/sha1.jpg`.\r\n\r\nTrack developers can setup a \"development pack\" using their track's sha1, however this may be tedious (having to update the name and the pack file for every new revision) \r\n\r\n**Regressions caused**:\r\n- Online UI no longer loads, due to missing files for pack select\r\n\r\n**Known Issues**:\r\n- TrackPack::getTrackList panics if TrackGameMode isn't exactly a specific mode, instead of returning a merged vector.","baseCommit":"2dc319003e268f15adeba6971c56846e308fccec"}
