{"timestamp":"1682449600","reviewRef":"refs/pull/693/head","targetRef":"refs/heads/main","requester":"GnomedDev","description":"Rename configure.py -\u003e build.py and make responsible for invoking ninja \n\nThis prevents issues of the `build.ninja` file becoming out of sync with reality by making `build.ninja` entirely temporary using the builtin `tempfile` library, then passing the path to this temporary file directly to `ninja`. This responsiblity change also allows for more complex logic to be built around the ninja invokation, since we control it.\r\n\r\nFor manual inspection of the resulting temporary file, `--dry` has been added to `build.py` which will produce the `build.ninja` in the current directory, although this will not be used for builds.\r\n\r\nOne issue that could arise is that people continue to run `ninja` with versions of `build.ninja` from before this change, although that should pretty quickly break and we can just tell them to use `build.py`.","baseCommit":"6ff0ac06a30cd4db1052c231d81104f8c0ce241d"}
