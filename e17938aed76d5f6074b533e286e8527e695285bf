{"timestamp":"1687101809","author":"Zachruff","description":"should this be called \"total racers\" instead? since i feel like \"players\" implies human players not CPUs\r\n\r\nalso \"The minimum player count, padded by CPU players.\" why is it \"minimum\" isnt it total? and maybe im being weird but I feel like padded is a weird term. Maybe simpler to say \"Total number of combined CPU and human racers\""}

{"timestamp":"1687102141","author":"GnomedDev","description":"Yeah, it's minimum as the setting could be set to `2` but with 4 local players, and it would still have all 4 local players. That name and description does sound saner though."}
