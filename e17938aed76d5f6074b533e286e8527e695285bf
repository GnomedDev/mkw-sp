{"timestamp":"1687101809","author":"Zachruff","description":"should this be called \"total racers\" instead? since i feel like \"players\" implies human players not CPUs\r\n\r\nalso \"The minimum player count, padded by CPU players.\" why is it \"minimum\" isnt it total? and maybe im being weird but I feel like padded is a weird term. Maybe simpler to say \"Total number of combined CPU and human racers\""}

{"timestamp":"1687102141","author":"GnomedDev","description":"Yeah, it's minimum as the setting could be set to `2` but with 4 local players, and it would still have all 4 local players. That name and description does sound saner though."}

I'd like to hear more opinions before merge.\r\n\r\nimo racer should be both human and CPUs, whereas player is just humans (since nintendo will refer to people as player 1, player 2, etc... and on the title screen you select \"3P\" mode for 3 player local for example). But then there is the issue of battles not technically being races but eh I still think using racer is fine. "}
