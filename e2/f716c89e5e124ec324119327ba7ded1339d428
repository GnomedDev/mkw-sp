This is needed for #884 and has been tested by bzip compressing the string `hello world`  then decompressing and printing that file fetched from `ResourceManager`.\r\n\r\nThis also provides implementations of `malloc` and `free`, for future vendored libraries.\r\n","baseCommit":"e752d41cb8906f24027c07514ba0b2546e5f0b1c"}
