Track metadata is then loaded from `/mkw-sp/Tracks`, which also contains the actual track files as `.arc.lzma`.\r\n\r\nThis is all managed by `TrackPackManager`, which is loaded on sections which require pack selection, then persists by using the `courseOrder` arrays introduced in #805 to store `Track` structs, which when needed are applied to `RaceConfig`.\r\n\r\nFurther work is planned to implement a server which would serve track/pack metadata files and tracks, aswell as UI to interact with this server, but currently this is purely offline and requires messing around with [Track Pack Generator](https://github.com/GnomedDev/track-pack-generator) to be usable, although this can currently convert CTGP and other packs to this format. `Wiimm-DB-Parser` is included in this PR to produce files for this tool, and in future form the basis for the server, but this could be removed and maintained separately if wanted.","baseCommit":"5619a14b4a82d083b7ea1f9f1034a4bc77525340"}
