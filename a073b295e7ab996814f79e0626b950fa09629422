Implementing a few APIs, they allow some SP classes to run sans-modification on PC targets. We might want to simply remove them altogether."}

{"timestamp":"1677164456","author":"GnomedDev","description":"This PR is just targeting `configure.py`, if you want me to make a followup PR to remove those classes I can, but it shouldn't bloat anything for those classes to be temporarily included in main."}

{"timestamp":"1677270699","author":"GnomedDev","description":"`configure.py` doesn't even take that long, and seeing that we are running lots of small scripts I can imagine pypy isn't helping that much (no time for JIT to warm up, might even be slower thinking about it)"}
